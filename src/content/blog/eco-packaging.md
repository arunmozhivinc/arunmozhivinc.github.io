description: Eco Packing - Sustainable Packaging Solution
---

## Table of contents

## **1. Introduction**  
**Eco Packing** is a sustainable packaging solution designed to minimize environmental impact while ensuring efficient and practical packaging practices. By leveraging modern technologies, this project integrates **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework, with **ReactJS**, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The system provides an **eco-friendly packaging management solution** that helps businesses adopt **sustainable materials**, optimize **packaging design**, and track **carbon footprint reduction**.

## **2. Key Features**  

### **Frontend Features (React.js):**  
- **User Dashboard**: Displays packaging options, eco-score, and sustainability insights.  
- **Order Management**: Users can select, customize, and track packaging orders.  
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Estimates environmental impact for different packaging choices.  
- **Interactive UI & Real-Time Updates**: Responsive, modern UI with live data visualization.  

### **Backend Features (NestJS):**  
- **Sustainable Material Database**: Stores data on eco-friendly packaging options.  
- **AI-Based Optimization Engine**: Suggests **best packaging materials** based on usage patterns.  
- **Order Processing System**: Manages **packaging orders** with real-time tracking.  
- **User Authentication & Roles**: Uses **JWT authentication & role-based access control (RBAC)**.  
- **API Integration**: Exposes REST & GraphQL APIs for third-party applications.

## **3. Technology Stack**  

| **Technology**  | **Purpose**  |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| **NestJS (TypeScript)** | Backend framework for business logic |
| **React.js** | Frontend UI framework |
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL** | Database for storing eco-friendly packaging data |
| **GraphQL / REST API** | API architecture for frontend-backend communication |
| **JWT + OAuth 2.0** | Secure authentication & authorization |
| **AWS / Google Cloud** | Cloud hosting & storage solutions |

---

## **4. System Workflow**  

### **Step 1: User Registration & Authentication**  
- Users register & log in using **JWT authentication**.  
- Role-based access (e.g., **Admin, SuperAdmin, Customer**) is assigned.  

### **Step 2: Packaging Selection & Optimization**  
- Users explore eco-friendly packaging materials via **interactive UI**.  
- AI-based engine suggests **optimized packaging** solutions.  

### **Step 3: Order Processing & Carbon Footprint Analysis**  
- Users place orders for **sustainable packaging**.  
- System calculates the **carbon footprint** and potential **cost savings**.  

### **Step 4: Tracking & Reports**  
- Users track order status in real time.  
- Reports on **eco-impact & savings** are generated for businesses.

## **5. Database Design**  

| **Table** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| `users` | Stores user credentials & roles |
| `packaging_materials` | Stores sustainable material options |
| `orders` | Tracks user orders & packaging requests |
| `carbon_footprint` | Stores data on environmental impact |
| `audit_logs` | Logs user actions for transparency |

---

## **6. Security & Performance Considerations**  

### **Security Measures:**  
- **JWT Authentication + OAuth 2.0** for secure API access.  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** to restrict unauthorized actions.  
- **Data Encryption** for secure storage of user and order details.  

### **Performance Optimizations:**  
- **Redis Caching** to store frequently accessed data.  
- **Database Indexing** for faster query performance.  
- **Asynchronous Processing** using NestJS **Event Emitter** for handling orders efficiently.

## **7. Deployment Strategy**  

| **Component** | **Deployment Method** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Frontend (React.js)** | Hosted on **Vercel / AWS S3** |
| **Backend (NestJS)** | **Dockerized & deployed on AWS EC2** |
| **Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** | Managed via **AWS RDS** |
